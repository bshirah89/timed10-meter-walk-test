## Read user story and breakdown tasks
## As a certified Prosthetist I want to record the results for the test on a form with the  fields listed
### 1)create form with fields according to example timed 10 meter walk test 
### 2) caclulate Average Self-Selected Velocity 
### 3) caclulate Average Fast-Velocity
## As a certified Prothetist I want the process to be easy to use to record the information

## As a certified Prosthetist, I want to be able to submit the results to a saved data storage
## As a certified Prosthetist, I want to be able to view the result in a text statement so that I could copy and paste the end result
## Other design considerations: 
### Does not need to pick a patient
### Does not need to authenticate user
### Does not need to focus on conducting the test
